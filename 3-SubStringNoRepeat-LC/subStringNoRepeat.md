## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

### Problem

Given a string s, find the length of the longest
substring without repeating characters.

#### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3
```

#### Example 2

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

#### Example 3

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

#### Constraints

-   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
-   `s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.`

### Preliminary Solution

-   **Time Complexity**: O(TIME)
-   **Space Complexity**: O(SPACE)

#### Initial Thoughts

First approach I am going to do with my sliding window is to create an object. Each character, I will add to the object. When I increase the size of the sliding window, if the character is in the dictionary already, then I know that it is already in the window.

Went down a rabbit hole of meeting all the test cases
