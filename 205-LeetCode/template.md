## [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/?envType=study-plan&id=level-1)

### Problem

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

#### Example 1

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

#### Example 3

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

#### Constraints

-   1 <= s.length <= 5 \* 104
-   t.length == s.length
-   s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

### Preliminary Solution

-   **Time Complexity**: O(TIME)
-   **Space Complexity**: O(SPACE)

#### Initial Thoughts

-   My first thought is how is this possible?
-   First lets look up a better way to describe Isomorphic
-   From my understanding, with the exmaple:
    Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
    Output: true
    If "t" was replaced with "p", "i" with "a", "l" with "e", and "e" with "r", it would be the same word
-   Have to figure out how to turn that into code

### [Best Available Solution](SOLUTION_LINK)

-   **Time Complexity**: O(TIME)
-   **Space Complexity**: O(SPACE)

#### _Backside_

Put a small compact description of the solution that can fit on the back of a flashcard here. It should describe the best approach you can find on the internet and is an improvement over the preliminary solution.

#### Additional Details

Put any additional details or detailed description of the solution here. Not meant to go on a flashcard, but should be something you refer to in the case that you don't understand your compact descriptions.
